# ðŸ“š API Concepts

This README provides a detailed overview of APIs, their components, tools, and practical examples to help you understand and work with APIs effectively.

---

## API Components

### ðŸ”¹ Request Components

- **Endpoint (URL)** â†’ Represents a resource. Example: `/books`
- **Method** â†’ Defines the action:
  - `GET` â†’ Fetch data
  - `POST` â†’ Create data
  - `PATCH/PUT` â†’ Update data
  - `DELETE` â†’ Remove data
- **Parameters**
  - **Query Parameters** â†’ `?type=fiction&limit=5`
  - **Path Parameters** â†’ `/books/1` (book with ID 1)
- **Request Body**
  - Data sent with POST/PUT/PATCH in JSON format.

### ðŸ”¹ Response Components

- **Status Code**
  - `2xx` â†’ Success
  - `4xx` â†’ Client Error
  - `5xx` â†’ Server Error
- **Response Data** â†’ JSON/object data returned.
- **Headers** â†’ Metadata (content-type, authorization, etc.).

---

## Tools for Working with APIs

- **Postman** â†’ Test APIs, send requests, view responses.
- **RapidAPI** â†’ API marketplace (like App Store for APIs).
  - Examples: Payment APIs (PayPal, Stripe), Weather APIs, Crypto APIs.

ðŸ‘‰ These tools save time, help developers integrate existing services, and avoid reinventing the wheel.

## Example: Books API

### 1. Endpoints

- `/status` â†’ Check if API is running.
- `/books` â†’ Get all books.
- `/books?type=fiction` â†’ Filter by type.
- `/books?limit=5` â†’ Limit results.
- `/books/1` â†’ Get book by ID.

### 2. Authentication (Orders Endpoint)

- Required for creating new orders.
- Uses an **access token**.
- Token must be saved and applied to all requests in the collection.

### 3. CRUD Operations in Books API

- **GET** â†’ Retrieve status, books, or a specific book.
- **POST** â†’ Place a new order (`bookId`, `customerName`).
- **PATCH** â†’ Update order (e.g., change customer name).
- **DELETE** â†’ Delete an order.
- **Note**: No PUT method available, only PATCH for updates.

### 4. Postman Workflow

- Save requests inside **collections**.
- Duplicate requests when switching methods (GET â†’ POST).
- Organize endpoints for easy testing.

## Learning Strategy

1. **Step 1** â†’ Practice APIs in Postman before coding.
2. **Step 2** â†’ Understand documentation â†’ endpoints, params, auth, etc.
3. **Step 3** â†’ Explore public APIs like CoinCap API for crypto data.
4. **Step 4** â†’ Move to code once comfortable with API testing.

## Classroom Practice & Next Steps

- Students must practice API calls using Postman.
- Next class will shift towards coding APIs.
- Students facing issues should ask peers or use online resources.
- Deployed student applications will be reviewed in upcoming sessions.

---

## Summary

- **APIs = Bridges connecting applications.**
- They work through requests (endpoint, method, params, body) and responses (status code, data, headers).
- Tools like Postman and RapidAPI help in testing and exploring APIs.
- **Example: Books API** demonstrates GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE with authentication.
- Practicing API calls first makes actual coding much easier.

**Pro Tip**: Always read API documentation carefully. Once you master testing in Postman, integrating APIs into your applications will become second nature!
